In this paper, we present a comprehensive performance analysis including performance, power consumption, temperature, productivity of programming and monetary cost for benchmarks on CPU, Nvidia GPU and Intel MIC architectures. Regarding efficiency, we evaluate the performance efficiency with respect to practical and theoretical performance, energy efficiency with respect to performance and power consumption, and monetary cost efficiency with respect to performance and monetary cost of the three architectures. To compare the overall benefits, we propose a unified efficiency metric for three architectures. In the future, our effort will focus on comparing three architectures on large-scale parallel and multi-node computer systems, so as to guide architecture and system design.
