 \textbf{\textit{Abstract}—
High performance computing systems using accelerators or co-processors have become popular, of which Nvidia GPU and 
Intel Xeon Phi Many Integrated Cores (MIC) are two main architectures.  
%In the area of high performance computing (HPC), parallel benchmarks are constantly used to explore and evaluate the performance of heterogeneous computing systems on the horizon. 
Previous and related work concentrates on measuring the performance and energy consumption of emerging 
heterogeneous architectures that consist of multi-core CPU, GPU and Intel Xeon Phi architectures,
while other factors such as temperature, efficiency and cost are considered as less important metrics.  
In this paper, we report our comprehensive evaluation of modern CPU, GPU, and Intel Xeon Phi using representative benchmarks of Rodinia
in terms of performance, efficiency, power consumption, energy efficiency, temperature, productivity and monetary cost. 
We then propose a unified metric that combines those results as a means for overall comparison of the three architectures. 
The metric helps users to comprehensively evaluate heterogeneous architecture from both software and hardware perspectives.}
